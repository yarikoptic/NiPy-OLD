""" Modifications to the standard profile.py API

    The standard profile.run() method in the Python library does not provide 
    access to variables available to the code snippet during a run.  For 
    example, the following fails:

        >>> a = 1 
        >>> profile.run("main(a)")

    This is because the variable 'a' will not properly be found.  This function
    fixes the problem.
"""

from profile import *

def run(statement, filename=None):
    """ Runs 'statement' under profiler, optionally saving results in 
    'filename'.

    This function takes a single argument that can be passed to the
    "exec" statement, and an optional file name.  In all cases this
    routine attempts to "exec" its first argument and gather profiling
    statistics from the execution. If no file name is present, then this
    function automatically prints a simple profiling report, sorted by the
    standard name string (file/line/function-name) that is presented in
    each line.
