 What is NIPY for?
===================

The purpose of NIPY is to do better brain imaging research.  We
believe that good neuroscience ideas and good analysis ideas develop
together.  Good ideas come from good understanding.  Understanding
comes from clarity, and clarity must come from well-designed teaching
materials and well-designed software.  The software must be designed
as a natural extension of the underlying ideas. 

We aim to build software that is:

* clearly written
* clearly explained
* a good fit for the underlying ideas
* a natural home for collaboration

We hope that, if we fail to do this, you will let us know.  We will
try and make it better.
