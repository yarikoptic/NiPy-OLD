 What is NIPY for?
===================

The purpose of NIPY is to make it easier to do better brain imaging
research.  We believe that neuroscience ideas and analysis ideas
develop together.  Good ideas come from understanding; understanding comes
from clarity, and clarity must come from well-designed teaching
materials and well-designed software.  The software must be designed
as a natural extension of the underlying ideas.

We aim to build software that is:

* clearly written
* clearly explained
* a good fit for the underlying ideas
* a natural home for collaboration

We hope that, if we fail to do this, you will let us know.  We will
try and make it better.
