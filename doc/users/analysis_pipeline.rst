You can load images in NIPY

.. testcode::

   from nipy.core.api import load_image
   print 'Hello'

   def f(x):
      """
      """
      return x**2

   for x in range(10):
      print f(x)

That probably worked.

.. testoutput::

   Hello

.. doctest::

   >>> print 'Hello'
   Hello

That's all folks
