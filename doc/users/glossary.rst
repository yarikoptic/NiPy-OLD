   voxels 

      Voxels are volumetric pixels - that is, they are values in a
      regular grid in three dimensional space - see
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel

   SPM

      SPM (statistical parametric mapping) refers to either the
      :term:`SPM analysis approach` or the :term:`SPM software`

   SPM analysis approach 
       
       Statistical parametric mapping is way of analyzing data, that `
       involves creating an image (the *map*) containing statistics.
       For example, we often create a t statistic image where each
       :term:`voxel` contains a t statistic value for the time-series
       from the voxel.
      
   SPM software
       
       SPM_ (statistical parametric mapping) software is the name of
       the matlab_ based package written by the team at the
       `Functional Imaging Laboratory`_ in London.
