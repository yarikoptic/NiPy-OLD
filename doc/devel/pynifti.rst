============
 Pynifti IO
============

We are using pynifti_ for the underlying nifti file I/O support.
Pynifti is built upon the nifticlibs_ so this will provide us will
*full* nifti support.  We are working closely with the author of
pynifti_, Michael Hanke, and pushing any bug fixes or feature
improvements upstream to the git repository.

Developers should read through Michael's documentation on the pynifti_
site for some details on the project.  The source is checked out from
the `git repository.

Git
---

Pynifti uses git_ for it's version control system.  Git is very
different from `svn <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`_, developers
should read some documentation on git before doing any work with the
git repository.

The git_ website has several tutorials and full documentation.  A good
starting point may be the `Git for SVN Users
