*Abstract:* This grant proposes the continued maintenance, testing, and
evaluation of the Neuroimaging in Python (NiPy) project. In particular,
we propose to apply best practices and proven methods for software design,
construction, and implementation to extend the applicability of NiPy to
the larger neuroimaging research community. By addressing the parallel
achievements and increased interdependence of neuroimaging research and
computing sciences, we will benefit the existing NiPy user community as
well as increasing the potential for NiPy to attract significantly more
developers and users. We will modernize, refactor, and further develop
NiPy into an easy to modify and extend software environment with the
ability to be repaired and evolved as the needs of the community of users
change. Working closely with the existing NiPy developer community, we aim
to improve and enhance NiPy in terms of infrastructure, architecture,
interoperability, usability, and reproducibility
