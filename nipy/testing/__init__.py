"""The testing directory contains a small set of imaging files to be used
for doctests only.  More thorough tests and example data will be stored in
a nipy-data-suite to be created later and downloaded separately.

Examples
--------

>>> from nipy.testing import funcfile
>>> from nipy.io.api import load_image
>>> img = load_image(funcfile)
>>> img.shape
(20, 2, 20, 20)

Notes
-----
BUG: anatomical.nii.gz is a copy of functional.nii.gz.  This is a place-holder
    until we build a proper anatomical test image.
