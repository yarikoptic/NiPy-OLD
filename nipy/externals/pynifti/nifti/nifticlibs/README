This directory contains a copy of the nifticlibs. The copy does not cover
the full distribution, but only the files:

  * nifti1.h
  * nifti1_io.[h,c]
  * znzlib.[h,c]
  * LICENSE

These files represent the functionality of the nifticlibs that is required
by PyNIfTI. Above files are included verbatim without any patches.

The purpose of the library copy is to lower the threshold to build PyNIfTI
on systems which do not provide proper developer packages for those libs.
Please do not build/link/use them on systems providing official library
packages (e.g. Debian and Ubuntu) and use those instead (security support,
maybe additional bugfixes, etc.)
