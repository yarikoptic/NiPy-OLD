    The file name is accessible as the .name attribute of the returned object.

    the underlying file gets deleted from the filesystem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    
      dir : str
        A path to use as the starting directory.  Note that this directory must
        already exist, it is NOT created if it doesn't (in that case, OSError

    Returns
    -------
      f : A file-like object.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> f = mlab_tempfile()
    >>> '-' not in f.name
    True
    >>> f.close()
