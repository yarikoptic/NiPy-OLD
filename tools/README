 Nipy Tools
============

This directory contains various tools used by the nipy developers.
Some of these are meant to be run from the command-line.  For these
command-line tools we're created an installer, setup.py, which
installs the tools in your bin directory and updates the mode to
executable.  To install the command-line tools simple do::

  python setup.py install
