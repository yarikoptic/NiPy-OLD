=========================
TODO for NIPY development
=========================

This list is currently not prioritized.

Testing framework
-----------------

- Fix the testing framework.  Remove the old test framework,
  neuroimaging.utils.testutils, make_doctest_suite.  Switch to using
  numpy's nost testing for numpy v1.2.

- Update all test modules to use the new test framework.

Tests
-----

Some issues specific to tests to cleanup.

- Remove creation of named temporary files "\*.nii", use NamedTemporaryFile 
  instead in test modules:

  * modalities/fmri/tests/test_regression.py 
  * modalities/fmri/fmristat/tests/test_model.py

- Affine is wrong in test_image.  Formats.Analyze reported 4x4 with
  MNI translation in 4th column.  PyniftiIO reports 5x5 with only one
  pixdim translation.

- NumpyTest.run() in __main__ blocks... doesn't instantiate NumpyTest.
  Tests cannot be run from command line.  Update to nose.

Trac Wiki
---------

- Update the README and INSTALL on the Trac Wiki.  These should
  reference a reST formatted version committed to the repository.
  Include information on downloading the fmri data and running the
  tests.

Nipy code base
--------------

- Update INSTALL and README so they are current.

- Remove ENTHOUGHT_TRAITS_DEF from neuroimaging.__init__.py, and any
  occurence of them in the code.  Need to update code using this to
  import modules as they are needed.

- Delete unused formats code.  Most code in
  neuroimaging.data_io.formats should be deleted.  Keep pyniftiio, and
  some of the struct utils.

- Move data_io to io package.

- Delete externals/enthought/traits.  We're not using traits for now.

- Delete neuroimaging/utils/path.py.  This custom path module does not
  provide any benefit over os.path.  Using a non-standard path module
  adds confusion to the code.  This will require going through the
  code base and updating all references to the path module.  Perhaps a
  good use of grin for a global search and replace.

- Delete the sandbox.

- Remove visualization.  May move this to a separate repos for future use?

- Convert from nipy datasource to numpy datasource.  Then remove
  nipy's datasource.py

- Delete any *weave* code.

- Remove configobj.

Code Design Thoughts
--------------------

Perhaps there's a better place for this, but I wanted a central
location to dump thoughts that could be shared by the developers and
tracked easily.  I also don't like having to switch from my code
editor to a browser just to jot down an idea like this.

Image Class
-----------

- save function should accept filename or file-like object.  If I have
  an open file I would like to be able to pass that in also, instead
  of fp.name.  Happens in test code a lot.

- Add dtype options when saving. When saving images it uses the native
  dtype for the system.  Should be able to specify this.  in the
  test_file_roundtrip, self.img is a uint8, but is saved to tmpfile as
  float64.  Adding this would allow us to save images without the
  scaling being applied.

- In image._open(url, ...), should we test if the "url" is a PyNiftiIO
  object already? This was in the tests from 'old code' and passed::
  
    new = Image(self.img._data, self.img.grid) 

  img._data is a PyNIftiIO object.  It works, but we should verify
  it's harmless otherwise prevent it from happening.

- Rename SamplingGrid to CoordinateMap.  Image.grid to Image.coordmap?

Image Iterators
---------------

- Cleanup the image iterators/generators.  I believe Jonathan was in
  the process of converting the code from using iterators to
  generators after the Paris Sprint.  This code transition is not
  complete.

Future Features
---------------

Egg support.  Look to revno 1642, a setup_egg.py that Gael had added.
This was removed as it did not work.
