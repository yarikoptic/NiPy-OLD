The PyNIfTI source in this directory is copied from the git source repository.
Any edits made to the PyNIfTI source should be done in the git repository and
copied into Nipy!  There is a script, utils/update_source.py that performs
this copy.  Not all of PyNIfTI is copied, only the files needed to use
PyNIfTI in Nipy.

There are a few files in externals/pynifti that are not copied, the packaging
files, __init__.py, nifti/__init__.py, info.py and the setup.py.  All other 
files in the nifti subdirectory are copied from the git repos.

See utils/update_source.py for more details.
