    first volume is recorded at exactly one second.

    't' might be a single value, a sequence or an array.

    The repetition 'tr' might be specified directly, but can also be a 
    NiftiImage object. In the latter case the value of 'tr' is determined from
    the 'rtime' property of the NiftiImage object.

    't' and 'tr' can be given in an arbitrary unit (but both have to be in the
    same unit).

    The 'lag' argument can be used to shift the times by constant offset.

    Please note that numpy.round() is used to round to interger value (rounds
    to even numbers). The 'decimals' argument will be passed to numpy.round().

    volumes are assumed to be along the first axis.

    volumes fx should be applied to. Each row defines a set of volumes.

    'fx' is a callable function to get an array of the selected volumes as
