    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array, points where the B-splines are to be evaluated
    knots : array, internal knots of the B-spline (see below for the
            boundary knots), assumed to be sorted
    m : integer, order of the B-spline, m=4 corresponds to cubic B-spline
    lower : integer, which of the basis functions to compute, lower limit
    upper : integer, which of the basis functions to compute, upper limit
            if < 0, defaults to (knots.shape[0]+m-2) when knots are
            added
    deriv : integer, order of derivative of B-spline to compute
    delta : float, offset to define boundary knots at right hand endpoint
    add_knots : prepend and append boundary knots using offset at right?
       
    Returns
    -------
    B : array of shape (upper-lower,) + x.shape
        Compute m-th order B-spline basis functions with specified internal
        knots at the points x. If deriv > 0, it is the
        derivative of the basis functions.

        The i-th row of B are the values B^(deriv)(m,i+1)(x) where B(m,i+1) is
        defined on p.161 of the first reference below.
        
    Notes
    -----
    
    Boundary knots are added using the following rule:

    tau = (m-1)*[knots[0]] + knots + [knots[-1]+delta*(knots.max()-knots.min())]*(m-1)

    The offset delta is arbitrary and ensures that all of the basis
    functions are continuously twice differentiable up to knots[-1].

    Values are computed using the recursive definition:

    C(m,i)(x) = ((x-tau[i])*C(m-1,i)(x)/(tau[i+m-1]-tau[i]) +
                 (tau[i+m] - x)*C(m-1,i+1)(x)/(tau[i+m]-tau[i+1]))

    where C(m,i) is the the function B(m,i+1)(x) in
    the first reference below (p.161).

    Derivatives are computed using a similar recursive definition
    
    D(m,i,j)(x) = (((x-tau[i])*(j <= 0) + (m-1) * (j > 0)) *       
                   D(m-1,i,max(j-1,0))(x)/(tau[i+m-1]-tau[i]) +
                   ((tau[i+m]-x)*(j <= 0) - (m-1) * (j > 0)) *       
                   D(m-1,i+1,max(j-1,0))(x)/(tau[i+m-1]-tau[i]))
    where D(m,i,j) is the j-th derivative of the function B(m,i+1)(x)
    in the first reference below (p.161).

    The recursive definition for the first derivative can be found
    many places, for instance in the second reference below. Extending
    it to higher order derivatives is not too difficult.
