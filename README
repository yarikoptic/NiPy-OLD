This is Neuroimaging in Python (NiPy) version 0.1
=================================================


What is NiPy?
----------------------

The aim of NiPy is to produce a platform-independent Python environment for
the analysis of brain imaging data using an open development model. 
  
While the project is still in its initial stages, packages for file I/O,
script support as well as single subject fMRI and random effects group
comparisons model are currently available.

Specifically, we aim to: 

    1. Provide an open source, mixed language scientific programming 
       environment suitable for rapid development.

    2. Create sofware components in this environment to make it easy 
       to develop tools for MRI, EEG, PET and other modalities.

    3. Create and maintain a wide base of developers to contribute to
       this platform.

    4. To maintain and develop this framework as a single, easily 
       installable bundle.
