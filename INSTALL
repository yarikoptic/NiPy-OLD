Source Code
===========

NIPY uses launchpad_ for our code hosting.  For immediate access to
the source code, see the `nipy launchpad`_ site.

Guidelines
==========

We have adopted many developer guidelines in an effort to make
development easy, and the source code readable, consistent and robust.
Many of our guidelines are adopted from the scipy_ / numpy_ community.
We welcome new developers to the effort, if you're interested in
developing code or documentation please join the `nipy mailing list`_
and introduce yourself.  If you plan to do any code development, we
ask that you take a look at the following guidelines.  We do our best
to follow these guidelines ourselves:

* :ref:`howto_document` : Documentation is critical.  This document
  describes the documentation style, syntax, and tools we use.

* `Numpy/Scipy Coding Style Guidelines:
  <http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/numpy/wiki/CodingStyleGuidelines>`_
  This is the coding style we strive to maintain.

* :ref:`bzr_workflow` : This describes our process for version control.

* :ref:`testing` : We've adopted a rigorous testing framework.

Checking out the latest version
===============================

To check out the latest version of nipy you need bzr version greater than
0.92::

    bzr branch lp:nipy

There are two methods to install a development version of nipy.  For
both methods, build the extensions in place::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Then you can either:

#. Use the ``mynipy`` script in the tools directory of the nipy
   source.  There are directions and examples in the docstring of that
   file, but basically it updates a symbolic link in your
   *site-packages* directory to the inplace build of your source.  The
   advantage of this method is it does not require any modifications of
   your PYTHONPATH.

#. Place the source directory in your PYTHONPATH.

With either method, all of the modifications made to your source tree
will be picked up when nipy is imported.


Submitting a patch
==================

The preferred method to submit a patch is to create a branch of nipy on
your machine, modify the code and push that branch to your launchpad
directory.  Then email the list and we will review your code and
hopefully apply (merge) your patch.  See the instructions for
:ref:`init_trunk_dev`.

If you do not wish to use bazaar and launchpad, please feel free to
file a bug report and submit a patch or email the `nipy mailing
list`_.

Bug reports
===========

If you find a bug in nipy, please submit a bug report at the `nipy
bugs`_ launchpad site so that we may fix it.
