Building
=========

You can build the neuroimaging package using::

    python setup.py build


Installing
===========

To install a non developpement version of the neuroimaging package use::

    sudo python setup.py install

Beware: this copies the source files in you Python site-packages
directory. Modifying these files will not modify what Python imports.

To install a development version of the neuroimaging, which follows all
the modifications made to your source tree use::

    sudo python setup.py develop --prefix /usr/local


Developing
===========

Checking out the latest version
--------------------------------

To check out the latest version of nipy you need bzr version greater than
0.92::

    bzr branch lp:nipy

Getting commit rights to nipy
------------------------------

To be able to commit directly changes in nipy, you need to create a
launchpad account, on https://launchpad.net/+login . Once you have done
that, you need to ask to be added to the nipy-developers team, on
https://launchpad.net/~nipy-developers . In addition, to be able to
commit using ssh, you need to add ssh keys to your launchpad account:
https://launchpad.net/~gael-varoquaux/+editsshkeys .

Working as with SVN
--------------------

If you modify local files and want to work directly in the launchpad
trunk, as you do with SVN, you need to do bind your local checkout to the
launchpad trunk::

    bzr bind bzr+ssh://gael-varoquaux@bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Enipy-developers/nipy/trunk 

You can then work as with SVN using "bzr add", "bzr commit", "bzr up".

Working in distributed version control mode
--------------------------------------------

If you have binded your local checkout, you can unbind it using::

    bzr unbind

Once you have done this, you can commit to your local checkout (which is
now a full standalone branch) using::

    bzr commit

This does not get pushed on the launchpad trunk, but only on your local
branch. When you want to push your changes to the launchpad trunk you
can do::

    bzr push bzr+ssh://gael-varoquaux@bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Enipy-developers/nipy/trunk 

using your launchpad account instead of gael-varoquaux. You need to
specify the destination only for the first push. To update you local
branch with the modifications in the launchpad trunk, you use::

    bzr pull lp:nipy

Once again, the pull location is necessary only the first time you pull.

The bzr documentation can be found on http://bazaar-vcs.org/Documentation
and is excellent.
