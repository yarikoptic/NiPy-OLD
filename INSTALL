 Getting Started
=================

NIPY uses launchpad_ for our code hosting.  For immediate access to
the source code, see the `nipy launchpad`_ site.  We have adopted many
developer guidelines in an effort to make development easy and the
source code readable, consistent and robust.  Many of our guidelines
are adopted from the scipy_ / numpy_ community.


developer guidelines
- bzr workflow
- nosetesting
- howto document
- coding standards
- bug reports

`Numpy/Scipy Coding Style Guidelines <http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/numpy/wiki/CodingStyleGuidelines>`_

Checking out the latest version
===============================

To check out the latest version of nipy you need bzr version greater than
0.92::

    bzr branch lp:nipy

To install a development version of the neuroimaging, build the
extensions in place.  If you have the source directory in your
PYTHONPATH, all the modifications made to your source tree will work::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Submitting a patch
==================

The preferred method to submit a patch is to create a branch of nipy on
your machine, modify the code and push that branch to your launchpad
directory.  Then email the list and we will review your code and
hopefully apply (merge) your patch.  See the instructions for
:ref:`init_trunk_dev`.

If you do not wish to use bazaar and launchpad, please feel free to
file a bug report and submit a patch or email the `nipy mailing
list`_.

Bug reports
===========

If you find a bug in nipy, please submit a bug report at the `nipy
bugs`_ launchpad site so that we may fix it.
